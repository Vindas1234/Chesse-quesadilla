# Chesse-quesadilla
In the recipe, you have to first make the filling, add cheese. onion, veggies, chicken, basically whatever you want.
Next, get chipati or anything similiar and put it with the filing, then get a second one and put it on top.
Putt it into the quessidilla maker, turn it on and leave it there until the maker says it is done, if it makes sounds, it is normally okay.
Cut it up, this step is optional.
Add some sauce, and sit back and eat.
